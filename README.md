# PAYROLL 'r US
You have been contracted to create payroll software for a bustling new startup. They know their company is set to grow, so they want this program built in a fashion that will allow them to add additional complexity and functionality without having to rebuild the application. This means you will be using strong OOP principles in your design. Inheritance and polymorphism will be integral to your design.
The program you design will list employees in the company roster, prompt you for information about the pay period such as if a bonus was given and how many hours the hourly employees work, and then output the list of employees longside the amount on their paycheck for the pay period. 
To do this project successfully, you will have to make use of Javaâ€™s interface and subclassing features. Look for commonalities between the different employee classes to find where to apply said features.
